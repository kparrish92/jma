## **Timeline and overview**

--

.large[
The US job market is yearly, and starts around September and lasts as late as April.
]

--

.large[
Job ads can be found in several places:

[MLA Joblist](https://joblist.mla.org/jobs/spanish/?fkw=)

[HigherEd Jobs](https://www.higheredjobs.com/faculty/search.cfm?JobCat=157&suggest=2)

[Linguist List](https://linguistlist.org/career/search/)
]

--

.large[
Many applicants update the status of their applications on [the jobs wiki](https://academicjobs.fandom.com/wiki/Spanish_and_Portuguese_2024-2025) 
]

---

## **Job applications**

--

Job applications require quite a bit of work and (sometimes) several customized documents including:

--

**Cover letter**: a two page document detailing your interest in the position, you research agenda, teaching experience, service, and, most importantly understanding of and fit in the position. .red[Always included.]

--

**CV**: a several page long document detailing publications, conferences attended, courses taught, etc. .red[Always included.]

--

**Teaching Statement**: usually a single page describing teaching philosophy and sometimes proposing specific courses. .blue[Often included.]

--

**Research Statement**: 2-4 pages going into detail about your research agenda, including past, present and future plans and specific funding sources. .blue[Often included.]

--

**DEI Statement**: A statement about your contributions to diversity, equity and inclusion. These are becoming less frequent due to an orange clown, or being reworded. These are typically a page long and should focus on how your work/service enhances DEI .purple[Sometimes included.]

--

**Mission or Religious Statement**: Some schools have religious (mostly Christian) affiliations and ask you to write about how your faith impacts you as a scholar. I am bad at these. .green[Rarely included.]

---

## **Job interviews**

--

Jobs often get 100+ applications and are reduced to a short list of ~15-20 candidates for zoom interviews.

Zoom interviews are typically around 30 minuntes long with the search committee (3-5 memebers of the faculty).

--

### **Typical questions**

**Fit** Why [insert University here]?

**Research** What is your 5 year research plan?

**Teaching** Propose courses/what would you teach? 

**Service** What is your mentoring style? 

**Money** How would you attract majors/increase enrollment? 

**Questions** Do you have questions for us? (Always ask 3)



---

## **Campus visits** 

.large[
After zoom interviews, campus visit happen. Most universities invite anywhere from **3 to 5 finalists** to campus for what is essentially a 2-3 day long interview. 
]

--

.large[
Campus visits are a test of **endurance** and **fit**.
]

--

.large[
There are mostly paid for by the University - but some work on a reimbursement system (Looking at you, Mississippi).
]

---

## **Typical eventson a campus visit**

--

**Job talk**: ~45 minute talk that is perhaps the most important part of your visit. Typically you talk about 3 studies of yours in the greater context of your research agenda and fit with the institution (here is mine for [Texas Tech](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fzePFtwPQki8Demmjv4jqmKq5QMj9pMMBGYxIXePnHs/edit?usp=sharing)). 

--

**Teaching demo**: A class, sometimes with a topic of their choosing (mine for [Brockport](https://kparrish92.github.io/job_slides/brockport/ug_teaching/index.html#1)).

--

**"Meeting" with the faculty/search committee**: This is not a formality - it's an interview much like the zoom interview. Be prepared with specific answers to the zoom interview questions. 

--

**Many meals**: You may have as many as three meals a day with faculty - they'll range in how much they treat it as an interview. (Though it always is, in a way).

--

**Meeting with the department chair**: A meeting that often discusses success in the position (tenure expectations etc.), teaching load, service etc. 

--

**Meeting with the dean**: This can be an interview, but also can be bigger picture financial things. Have questions prepared, and be ready to answer the general interview questions with an emhpasis on how you can aid things like enrollment.

## **Job offers** 

Eventually, they offer one person they job. Importantly, not every place gets their first choice. Decision making varies by institution, but generally, there is a ranking and a vote whether or not one is "acceptable". 

### **Components of a tenure track offer**

**Salary**: This might be negotiable, but often is not. Always ask unless they say they can't move on salary up front. For comparisons, many US universities list salaries publically. 

**Start up funds**: These can range from 0 to 50,000. You should think about what you would ask for and its general cost, because folks will ask in general what you need.

**Teaching Load**: Can range from 2-2 (the fewest possible without releases, usually) to 4-4 (considered full time teaching) or more.

**Course Releases**: It is possible to teach 1 or 2 fewer courses in the first few years (pre-tenure course release) to focus on research.

**Moving Expenses**: Big universities often offer up to 10k cash (which is taxed), while small schools offer none or 2-3k (reimbursment sometimes too)

**Summer salary**: Can be 1/9th (or 2/9ths) your regular salary (9 month salary) to work on research over the summer.

.content-box-grey[
.large[
**My data (I want to get more people's data)**: 

Applied to **53 jobs**

Interviewed at **8 jobs**

Campus visit at **3 jobs**

Ended up with **2 offers** (one was early at a community college)

**Timeline**

Based on data from the wiki (~70 total jobs)

Zoom interviews for 95% of the jobs are scheduled between 25-37 (median 32) days after the application deadline.

Campus visits are sent between 18-31 days after the initial zoom interview request (median 24.3 days).

Offers range from to 57 to 73 (median 65) days from the campus visit invitation.

## **Mental Health and ghosting**

.large[
The truth about it is that the academic job market in the US is absolutely brutal.
]

--

.large[
There are long periods of waiting and uncertainty. I find it best to give myself extra time to decompress.
]

--

.large[
Unfortunately, "ghosting" is something that can happen, even after the campus visit stage. There is not much you can do to prevent this other than ask about decision timelines and set your own date to assume it is a "no".
]

--

.large[
**Take care of yourself first** and then worry about the future. Prioritize sleep and things you can control.
]
